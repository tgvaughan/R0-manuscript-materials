# R0 manuscript materials

This repository contains the BEAST 2 XML files and R scripts needed to
replicate the analyses presented in the manuscript "Estimates of
outbreak-specific SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological parameters from genomic
data".

The files are organized as follows:

* `sequences/` contains details of which SARS-CoV-2 genomes were used
  from GISAID, including the table of acknowledgements listing the
  contributing individuals, labs and organizations.
  To reproduce analyses, the appropriate sequence data must be included
  in this folder. (For details, see the README.md file in this folder.)

* `XMLs/` contains the BEAST 2 XML input files necessary to replicate
  the analyses.  These analysis files require BEAST 2.6.7 to run
  correctly.  (For further details, see the README.md file in this folder.)

* `R_scripts/` contains the R scripts used for post-processing and
  generating the figures presented in the manuscript. (For further details,
  see the README.md in this folder.)
